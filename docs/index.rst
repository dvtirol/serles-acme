Introduction
------------

Serles is a tiny ACME-CA implementation to enhance your existing Certificate
Authority infrastructure. Initially developed to support ACME with the Open
Source version of PrimeKey's EJBCA's (ACME support is only available in the
Enterprise version), the software is designed for easy adaptation to other PKI
software/CAs which provide an API to issue certificates.

We sometimes call it a proxy, as it delegates certificate issuance to your
existing PKI. From a user's point of view, serles-acme can be your own private
*Let's Encrypt*, when combined with EJBCA.

If you want to use another PKI, feel free to implement your own backends.
Contributions are welcome.

Who is this project for?

- You want to build up your own PKI, either for company or home use
- You want to automate the issuing process for all your devices
- You already use another PKI Software and want to use certbot with it

Architecture
------------

Serles is intended to automate certificate issuance from your existing CA. It
will verify the legitimacy of certificate requests, and, if this is the case,
pass them on to a plugin/backend.

.. code-block:: text

  +--------+                            +--------+                        +---------+
  |        | (1) ---{authentication}--> |        |                        | Backend |
  |  Web   | (2) ---{order cert}------> | Serles |                        |  (e.g.  |
  | Server | <-----{validation}-----(3) |  ACME  |                        |  EJBCA) |
  |        | (4) ---{CSR}-------------> |        | (5) ---{CSR}---------> |         |
  +--------+ <-----{certificate}--- (7) +--------+ <--{certificate}-- (6) +---------+

The threat model is *execution inside a (trusted) enterprise network*. Yet, care
has been taken when accepting any user data. While there is no user
authentication (i.e. anyone who can access Serles is allowed to ask for
certificates), one may specify to which IP subnets requested domains must
resolve in order to be granted a certificate.

Installation
------------

See :ref:`installation`.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration file can be set using the ``CONFIG`` environment variable. If it
is absent, it is loaded from ``/etc/serles.ini``. An extensively commented
example configuration file is included as ``config.ini.example``. You may copy
(and rename) it to the beforementioned location. Serles is compatible with any
WSGI server; please consult your server's manual for its configuration.

Backends
--------

The software ships with a few predefined backends, but it is easy to write others.
If you do, please send patches!

A backend is simply a class (no inheritance required) and has the following methods:

- a constructor taking the parsed config (``ConfigParser`` object; ``dict``-like)
- a method ``sign(self, csr, subjectDN, subjectAltNames, email)``:  

    Parameters:  

    - ``csr``: the CSR as coming from the client (in PEM-encoded PKCS#10 format)
    - ``subjectDN``: The CSR's Distinguished Name as a string or, if absent, one
      created from the template string in the config file.
    - ``subjectAltNames``: a list of domain names (as strings) that are to be
      written in the certificate's SAN extension attributes.
    - ``email``: the email stored in the requesting account (or ``None``).
      Intended to be passed on to the backend for notification of the client.
    
    Returns:  

    - on success, the tuple ``(pem_chain, None)`` where ``pem_chain`` is the
      full PEM-encoded certificate chain.
    - on error, the tuple ``(None, error_msg)``, where ``error_msg`` is a string
      (possibly forwarded from the backend) that describes why the CSR has been
      rejected. This is forwarded to the client in a ``badCSR`` problem document.

.. code-block:: python

  class SomeBackend:
      def __init__(self, config):
          self.config = config
      def sign(self, csr, subjectDN, subjectAltNames, email):
          return None, "not implemented"

Optionally, one can also inherit from the abstract ``serles.backends.base``:

.. code-block:: python

  class SomeBackend(serles.backends.base):
      def sign(self, csr, subjectDN, subjectAltNames, email):
          return None, "not implemented"

EJBCA SOAP Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All you need is a user that has permission_ to issue certificates. Set up a
Certificate Authority (e.g. testca), an End Entity Profile (e.g. acmeendentity)
and a Certificate Profile (e.g. acmeserverprofile). Set up and enroll a user
with a client certificate which will be used to talk to the API.

When issuing certificates, the Username and Enrollment Code will be generated
from a template. This template can be configured in the config; you can use
parameters from the Distinguished Name (from CSR) by wrapping them in curly
braces.

If the client sets a contact email, we will pass it on to EJBCA when forwarding
the CSR. EJBCA can then be configured to send notifications for the
EndEntityProfile.

CertBot Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All you need is an existing installation of certbot on the host running serles that
is capable of issuing certificates. Serles can then use certbot for any client
requests. This is generally used in conjunction with DNS based validation.

At a minimum for setup, you will want to provide certbot.config or certbot.config-file
specifying what method to use for validation of certificates and any necessary
configuration for that method. You will need to refer to your particular certbot
backend for minimum configuration required.

The certbot plugin is _usually_ used with a DNS backend, however if you have your
serles installation in a DMZ with a wildcarded host or similar, you could potentially
use the http-01 based validation.

For Route53 with credentials already set up in environment, this may be sufficient:

  preferred-challenges=dns
  dns-route53

For CloudFlare:

  preferred-challenges=dns
  dns-cloudflare
  dns-cloudflare-credentials=/path/to/cloudflare.ini

See certbot documentation for more details and other providers:

  https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#dns-plugins

If you have set up certbot for serles to have it's own installation directories,
you may want to specify those here otherwise make sure that serles is running with a
userid that has filesystem perms to write to the certbot directories.

Additional configuration in that case assuming "/local/acme/certbot" installation
path.

  config-dir=/local/acme/certbot/config
  work-dir=/local/acme/certbot/work
  logs-dir=/local/acme/certbot/logs


Dependencies
------------

Dependencies are stated in ``setup.py``. If the available python-cryptography
version is less than 3.1, the openssl command line utility (somewhere in
``$PATH``) is required.

Notes on threads and databases
------------------------------

The database is used to hold the state between requests, but once an order has
been fulfilled (or rejected), all data relating to it is no longer used (and
actually deleted when the order expires, 7 days after its creation). It is
therefore sufficient to store this database in-memory. However, this in-memory
database is not thread safe. Depending on your requirements, either set
``database`` in ``config.ini`` to an on-disk DB, or (when using gunicorn) limit
the number of worker processes and threads to 1.

Note that certbot tries to re-use account IDs, so when using an in-memory DB
pass ``--pre-hook 'rm -rf /etc/letsencrypt/accounts'`` to it, to avoid this
behaviour.

Note that when using the EJBCA backend, you should only allow a single
connection at a time (i.e. single-threading), since there are concurrency
problems in the EJBCA software.
